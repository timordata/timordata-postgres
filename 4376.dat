219	2013	Impact of Rice Imports on Rice Production in Timor-Leste\r\n	\N	Impact of Rice Imports on Rice Production in Timor-Leste\r\n	\N	\N	The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) which advises the Ministry of Agriculture and\r\nFisheries’ (MAF’s) Seeds of Life III Program (MAF-SoL) recommended that MAFSoL\r\ncomplete a series of studies which focus on issues which have the potential to\r\ninfluence and guide Timor-Leste’s national food security policy, and its underlying\r\nnational seed production and distribution policy. This recommendation reflects the\r\nTAG’s (and other Development Partners’) concerns that some current policies\r\n(such as rice importation and price subsidization) are impacting negatively on\r\nsectoral development initiatives, such as MAF-SoL’s introduction of new staple\r\nfood crop1 varieties and MAF’s plan to refurbish damaged irrigation schemes2.\r\n\r\nTherefore MAF-SoL employed a Consultant3 to complete four studies4:\r\n\r\n(i) An economic comparison of the impact of imported rice on the (irrigated5)\r\nrice production sector, and its cost-effectiveness, compared with\r\ninvestments in crop (production) inputs and distribution - to inform the\r\nfood security policy;\r\n\r\n(ii) An assessment of the effects on the agricultural sector of imported seed of\r\nuntested varieties (which are) distributed free (to farmers) by MAF,\r\ncompared with a research-based process of varietal identification (and\r\nassociated) national seed production - to inform the policy on seed\r\n(production and distribution);\r\n\r\n(iii) An assessment of the effects on the formal and informal seed sectors of\r\ntargeting vs. non-targeting (for) the distribution of free seed by MAF - to\r\ninform the policy on seed; production and distribution; and\r\n\r\n(iv) An assessment of the comparative impact of implementing the\r\nInternational Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) funded Timor-\r\nLeste Maize Storage Project (TLMSP) as currently planned (independent\r\nfrom MAF-SoL), compared with complementary collaboration with MAFSoL\r\nin TLMPS’s target districts.\r\n\r\nThis report presented here is on the first study. This study was completed in early\r\n2013. Since then some of the financial and economic models have been updated as\r\npart of additional analysis of irrigation economics in Timor-Leste for the Ministry\r\nof Finance and the World Bank.

Interviews were conducted with 43 out of the 203 LIFT farmer groups in\r\nthese areas to gather information on their experiences over the three years they had\r\nworked together. The purpose of the study was to understand better what factors help\r\ngroups to survive and thrive, and what factors causes other groups to cease operation.\r\n\r\nDuring the LIFT program CARE supported integrated activities through direct\r\nimplementation of field activities by CARE field officers and by local NGOs in Liquiça and\r\nBobonaro. At suco level ten field officers supported all groups in 21 sucos, each of which\r\nwas home to 20 groups. After the LIFT program finished, the suco extension officers\r\n(SEOs) from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) continued to support the\r\nfarmer groups.\r\n\r\nThe study shows that the social cohesion between the group members, and the personal\r\ninvestment of group members in the group’s activities are important factors for the\r\nsuccess of a group. When a group is more cohesive by having shared goals between the\r\nmembers, the group tends to be better capable to overcome difficulties it encounters.\r\nThe characteristics of the group’s leader and the relationship and support provided by\r\nthe program’s field officers are also important.\r\n\r\nApart from the group’s social capital, the support and attention of the SEO after the LIFT\r\nprogram finished was essential. Without the SEO’s support some of the groups\r\ndissolved as they had difficulties to overcome challenges they faced. There were\r\nhowever also other groups that continued to manage and survive without the support\r\nfrom the SEO.\r\n\r\nGroups close to local markets benefitted from this condition, and continued to grow,\r\nand even expanded their vegetable production to earn extra income to support their\r\nfamily needs, in particular to pay for the schooling of their children. In more isolated\r\nsucos, successful groups do not have the same market proximity advantage; an excess of\r\nvegetables quickly results in a saturated market, and the extra produce cannot be sold,\r\nor at very reduced prices. SEOs can play a crucial role in building the sense of\r\ncommunity in the group and finding alternative economic activities which makes it\r\nimportant for the SEO to have a good relationship with the groups.\r\n\r\nSEOs mention that working with farmer groups that have previously been supported by\r\nan international NGO is sometimes hampering their current interaction with the\r\nfarmers or after taking over. The SEOs involvement with the groups is often seen as less\r\nvaluable as MAF has less funding/budget for physical handouts and training, which are\r\nfrequently provided by the NGOs. The strength of the SEOs is their commitment, small\r\n2 Local Initiatives for Food-security Transformation\r\nPage iv\r\nseed availability and interaction they have with the groups throughout the agricultural\r\ncycle. The farmer group’s lack of appreciation may in turn influence the SEO’s\r\nmotivation and his/her commitment to the group.\r\n\r\nThe integrated nature of the LIFT program made that interventions were supporting the\r\nsocial capital of the farmer groups, providing technical and mentoring support for the\r\nfull agricultural cycle, from seed production with high quality seeds provided by the\r\nSeeds of Life program, support through the distribution of airtight containers for seeds\r\nstorage, preparation of organic fertilizer and pesticides, home gardening and\r\nconstruction of water ponds up to nutrition training at family level. The increase of\r\ntechnical expertise was continuously used in the groups and the farmers used it also\r\nindividually.\r\n\r\nThe improved varieties provided by SoL were important to set off the production of\r\nseeds which in the following years could be distributed to the wider community.\r\nHowever, during the study the respondents commented on the reduction of quality of\r\nthe seeds as the groups faced cross-pollination of the seeds and lower yield.	\N	The study on the sustainability of farmer groups undertaken by SoL in 2013 shows that\r\nthere are a number of factors, which determine whether or not a farmer group thrives.\r\nThe case study focused on relatively long-established (three to five years) farmer\r\ngroups, established by CARE under the LIFT2 program (2007-2010) in 21 sucos in the\r\nsub-district Maubara, district Liquiça, and in the sub-district Bobonaro, district\r\nBobonaro.

Drawing on mixed-method empirical research carried out on nine public agencies in Lao PDR, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, and Timor Leste, this volume identifies the shared causal mechanisms underpinning institutional success in fragile states by examining the inner workings of these institutions, along with the external operational environment and sociopolitical context in which they exist. Successful institutions share and deploy a common repertoire of internal and external operational strategies. In addition they connect this micro-institutional repertoire to the macro-sociopolitical context along three discernible pathways to institutional success.

Most studies on explanatory factors to adoption are discipline specific or follow the innovation-diffusion paradigm, the economic constrain paradigm or the adopters perception paradigm, all focusing on different categories of explanatory factors related to adoption. Based on the three adoption paradigms and seven selected documents, a cross-disciplinary conceptual framework was developed. To identify factors related to adoption of improved food crop varieties in Timor-Leste and across agro-ecological zones, binary logistic regression was performed on data collected from 1511 rural households. The results of the analysis showed that several factors were related to adoption. The factor found to be most strongly related to adoption was having a relationship to an improved food crop variety grower and the closeness of this relationship. Furthermore, with differences across agro-ecological zones, the following factors were found to be related to adoption: districts where activities related to the improved food crop varieties had taken place; familiarity and involvement with the programme developing the improved food crop varieties; gender; age; number and size of farming plots; travel time between household and farming plot; and ownership of means of transportation. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that adoption can be improved by targeting social networks and designing programmes sensitive to agro-ecological zones.	\N	Factors related to adoption of new agricultural technologies have been given increasing attention, especially in developing countries where such technologies offer opportunities to enhance food security.

While gender quotas can be a useful tool to encourage women's political participation, these structural issues need to be recognised and addressed in order to truly empower women.	\N	This article examines the experiences of women occupying reserved seats on the suku councils of Timor-Leste (each of which represents a number of small villages).

This paper illustrates this proposition through a brief investigation of the situation in Timor-Leste as the UN mission withdraws at the five-year state-building mark, and in Haiti as a ninth UN mission is established. Adopting the view that participatory democratic governance will best ensure long-term peace, the paper maintains that to build sustainable peace requires transformation on three interrelated fronts: (a) transformation of the society from one that resorts to violence to one that resorts to political means to resolve conflict, requiring that the elite negotiate and that there should be widespread social dialogue and reconciliation; (b) reform of the governance framework to seek to ensure both that a negotiated governance arrangement between parties prevents future conflict and the adoption of basic democratic governance; and (c) the creation of meaningful institutions that will be sustainable after the mission leaves. These institutions cannot be imposed from outside, but must be bodies that re able to perform their core function and are committed to doing so.	\N	The overarching challenge facing the growing number of international peace-building interventions is to achieve sustainable peace.

Commencing in 2000, the US$18 million project provided funds to over 400 local development councils that had been newly created to meet their community's development needs. Rather than creating genuine participatory structures, tight deadlines to disburse project funds and bureaucratic project rules reduced the councils to little more than transmission lines to Bank-controlled dollars. By bypassing existing governance structures, including that of the fledging government, the councils also bypassed sources of local legitimacy and technical knowledge, which resulted in community conflict, indifference, and poor project sustainability.

It argues that it is vital for the development of stable, independent, and viable civil societies that international NGOs promote a bottom-up approach in their support to and collaboration with local NGOs, especially among those emerging from situations of conflict or other profound social disruptions. From a study carried out in East Timor, the author concludes that there is a noticeable discrepancy between rhetoric and practice with regard to such support. The multiple challenges the international NGO community faces on this front persist despite the existence of abundant learning opportunities accumulated through years of development work. The author argues that such challenges are less a question of standards and rules than of basic approach, attitudes, and power relations. She maintains that if international NGOs and the wider international community do not alter their approach, they will suffocate rather than foster the development of a viable and autonomous civil society in the countries in which they operate.	\N	This article seeks to contribute to the debate on collaboration between national and international NGOs.

Women’s Access to Land and Property Rights in the Plural Justice System of Timor-Leste.	\N	\N	The Centre of Studies for Peace and Development (CEPAD) with support from UN Women, conducted\r\nparticipatory action research over a period of 12 months in order to examine women’s access to justice\r\nin the plural legal system of Timor-Leste with a focus on women’s rights to land and property. The\r\ninterconnection between land, gender and justice in Timor-Leste is particularly important to examine in\r\nlight of draft land legislation which is currently tabled in the National Parliament as well as a\r\nforthcoming law on customary justice and a forthcoming law on mediation which are in the drafting\r\nstages within the Ministry of Justice.
